### Here's a brief look at what I'm up to right now:
* Working through fast.ai's [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) MOOC to get hands on exposure to machine learning.
* Steadily stepping through [Project Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) to keep stretching my brain and working on my programming skills.
